Things I think might be nice to implement

* Vertical/Horizontal Maximizing of MDI child windows
* Changing the mouse cursor while moving/resizing window
  This one requires some kind of hooking into other windows'
  event loops, which makes it kinda hackish, but if there is
  enough request for this feature, I might one day take 
  another look at it.
